## How to run the code
### Training
First, install the required packages in your environment, and then log in to the wandb.

Run the command for traing the model:

```
python main.py -m train -c config.yaml -md attention 
```
- `-m`: Selects the mode to run (train or test).  
- `-c`: Specifies the path to the configuration file (config.yaml by default).
- `-md`: Chooses the model to use (mlp or attention).  In baseline, the model is MLP.

### Testing
```
python main.py -m test -c config.yaml -md attention 
```

## Ablations
Check the `ablations.py` file. Itâ€™s used for conducting ablations sequentially. 

## Results
| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Baseline | 0.8640 | 0.8671 | 0.8640 | 0.8647 |
| MLP | 0.8737 | 0.8760 | 0.8737 | 0.8742 |
| **Attention** | **0.8927** | **0.8921** | **0.8923** | **0.8921** |
